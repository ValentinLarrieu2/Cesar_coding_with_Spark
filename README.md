# Cesar_coding_with_Spark

The goal of this project is to implement a ciphering and deciphering method on text messages. We want that knowing the original language in which the message is written and the ciphering algorithm (here Cesar), the people receiving the message to be able to decode it in order to read the original text.

Please look at Cesar_coding_with_Spark_report.pdf to get the details about the implementation and the results
